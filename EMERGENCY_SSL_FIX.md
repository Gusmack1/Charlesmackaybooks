## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - DO THIS RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: GO TO NETLIFY DASHBOARD IMMEDIATELY
1. **Open**: https://app.netlify.com/projects/same-qxqc4bjp6s1-latest/domain-management
2. **Find the HTTPS section**

2. **Click the "..." menu** next to the domain
3. **Click "Remove domain"**
4. **Wait 30 seconds**
5. **Click "Add custom domain"**
6. **Enter**: `charlesmackaybooks.com`
7. **Click "Add domain"**

### Step 3: FORCE NEW SSL CERTIFICATE
After re-adding the domain:
1. **Netlify will automatically provision a new SSL certificate**
2. **Wait 2-5 minutes**
3. **Test**: https://charlesmackaybooks.com

## TEMPORARY WORKAROUND (IMMEDIATE)
**Your working site URL**: https://same-qxqc4bjp6s1-latest.netlify.app

**For immediate book sales**:
- Share this Netlify URL on social media
- Update any advertising to point to the .netlify.app URL temporarily
- This URL works perfectly - customers can buy books now

## EXPECTED TIMELINE
- **Domain removal/re-add**: 2 minutes
- **New SSL certificate**: 5-15 minutes  
- **Full resolution**: Within 30 minutes

## BACKUP PLAN
If the above doesn't work within 30 minutes:
1. We'll set up a CNAME record instead of A record
2. Or temporarily use Cloudflare proxy to bypass SSL issues

## VERIFICATION
Once fixed, this command should work:
```bash
curl -I https://charlesmackaybooks.com
```
