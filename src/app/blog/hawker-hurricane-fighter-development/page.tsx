    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction: The Fighter That Saved Britain</h2>
    <p>The Hawker Hurricane stands as one of aviation history's most significant fighters - the aircraft that bore the brunt of the Battle of Britain and saved the nation in its darkest hour. While the Spitfire captured public imagination, it was the Hurricane that shot down more enemy aircraft during the battle, equipped the majority of Fighter Command squadrons, and provided the backbone of Britain's air defense.</p>
    
    <p>Designed by Sydney Camm and first flying in November 1935, the Hurricane represented Hawker's transition from fabric-covered biplanes to modern monoplane fighters. Its development bridged traditional construction methods with advanced aerodynamics, creating an aircraft that was both revolutionary and producible in the quantities needed for total war.</p>

    <p>The Hurricane's service record extends far beyond the Battle of Britain. From the opening campaigns in France through the Western Desert, Burma, and the Eastern Front, Hurricanes served in every theater of World War II. Over 14,500 were produced, making it the most numerous British fighter and one of the most important aircraft in RAF history.</p>

    <h2 id="design-development">Design and Development Revolution</h2>
    <p>Sydney Camm's Hurricane design represented a carefully balanced evolution from biplane to monoplane configuration. Rather than pursuing radical innovation, Camm applied proven Hawker construction techniques to a modern monoplane layout, ensuring the aircraft could be manufactured quickly using existing production capabilities and workforce skills.</p>

    <p>The Hurricane's mixed construction combined a steel tube framework with fabric covering aft of the cockpit and metal panels forward. This approach provided structural strength and damage resistance while enabling rapid production and field repairs. The design philosophy prioritized practicality and operational effectiveness over theoretical perfection.</p>

    <p>Engine selection proved crucial to the Hurricane's success. The Rolls-Royce Merlin provided excellent power-to-weight ratio and reliability, while its glycol cooling system enabled the streamlined nose profile essential for modern fighter performance. The close collaboration between Hawker and Rolls-Royce established patterns for future British aircraft development.</p>

    <h2 id="battle-britain">Battle of Britain: The Hurricane's Finest Hour</h2>
    <p>During the Battle of Britain, Hurricanes equipped 32 of Fighter Command's 52 operational squadrons, reflecting both the aircraft's numerical superiority and tactical importance. Hurricane pilots claimed approximately 60% of all enemy aircraft destroyed during the battle, establishing the type's reputation as a formidable air-to-air combat platform.</p>
