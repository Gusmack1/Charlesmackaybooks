    <h2 id="context">Context and Documents</h2>
    <p>
      The Allied atomic program unfolded across laboratories, cabinet rooms, and battlefields. Documents—the MAUD reports, Quebec Agreement, Combined Policy Committee papers, and 1945 public statements—trace the political‑scientific arc from idea to weapon. The Alsos Mission’s field intelligence closed the loop, testing assumptions about German progress and securing people, papers, and materials.

    </div>

    <h2 id="maud">MAUD Committee Findings (1940–41)</h2>
    <p>
      British physicists concluded a uranium bomb was feasible within wartime timescales, recommending concentrated effort. The MAUD memoranda, circulated to the U.S., catalysed American re‑mobilisation and the creation of the Manhattan Engineer District. Their legacy is both technical and institutional: they bound science to national strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read alongside auxiliary memoranda, MAUD clarified cost, plant scale, and time estimates for isotope separation and reactor work. The documents also show friction points: classification, intellectual‑property handling, and wartime urgency versus scientific caution. Their transmission to the U.S. helped reset American assumptions and unlocked resources at decisive scale.
    </p>

    <h2 id="agreements">The Quebec Agreement and Allied Coordination</h2>
    <p>
      The 1943 Quebec Agreement framed UK–US cooperation: pooled resources, managed information flows, and promised postwar coordination. Subsequent arrangements created the Combined Policy Committee and outlined patent and production settlements. The documentation reveals the balancing act between secrecy, sovereignty, and urgency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Combined Policy Committee minutes show working‑level problem‑solving: personnel clearances, site security, and production priorities. The patent accords sought to minimise postwar friction among partners while enabling free wartime exchange. These texts, when traced across dates, expose how alliance management navigated the line between necessary secrecy and scientific collaboration.
    </p>

    <h2 id="alsos">Alsos Mission and Field Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Alsos units followed advancing fronts to assess—and arrest—the German nuclear effort. Reports and captured papers indicated a smaller, more fragmented program than feared. Beyond neutralising risks, Alsos built a documentary record that shaped Allied historiography, clarifying what Germany did—and did not—achieve by 1945.
    </p>
    <p>
      Field teams combined scientists and counter‑intelligence. Their reporting cadence—situation summaries, interrogation notes, document catalogues—fed planners and postwar analysts alike. The evidentiary base they compiled still anchors scholarly reconstructions of the German program’s scale, priorities, and dead‑ends.

    </div>

    <h2 id="statements">Public Statements of August 1945</h2>
    <p>
      The first public statements by Churchill, Truman, and Canadian ministers framed the weapon’s use and intent. Read together with technical annexes and postwar releases, they illuminate decision‑making, scientific credit, and the emerging narrative of deterrence and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      These texts established the official line on purpose, authorship, and control mechanisms. Comparing drafts and final releases reveals emphasis choices—how much science to disclose, how to credit contributors, and how to position the weapon within emerging international politics.
    </p>

    <h2 id="legacy">Legacy for Policy and Scholarship</h2>
    <p>
      The atomic archive continues to inform debates on secrecy, alliance management, and civil–military relations. For students, reading the documents themselves remains indispensable, restoring nuance sometimes lost in later summaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      For researchers, triangulating committee papers with production data and intelligence reporting guards against over‑reliance on any single narrative. The documentary spine here—MAUD, Quebec Agreement, Combined Policy Committee minutes, Alsos reports, and 1945 statements—offers a verifiable path through complexity.
