    <h2 id="context">Context and Documents</h2>
    <p>
      The Allied atomic program unfolded across laboratories, cabinet rooms, and battlefields. Documents—the MAUD reports, Quebec Agreement, Combined Policy Committee papers, and 1945 public statements—trace the political‑scientific arc from idea to weapon. The Alsos Mission’s field intelligence closed the loop, testing assumptions about German progress and securing people, papers, and materials.

    <h2 id="maud">MAUD Committee Findings (1940–41)</h2>
    <p>
      British physicists concluded a uranium bomb was feasible within wartime timescales, recommending concentrated effort. The MAUD memoranda, circulated to the U.S., catalysed American re‑mobilisation and the creation of the Manhattan Engineer District. Their legacy is both technical and institutional: they bound science to national strategy.
    </p>

    <h2 id="agreements">The Quebec Agreement and Allied Coordination</h2>
    <p>
      The 1943 Quebec Agreement framed UK–US cooperation: pooled resources, managed information flows, and promised postwar coordination. Subsequent arrangements created the Combined Policy Committee and outlined patent and production settlements. The documentation reveals the balancing act between secrecy, sovereignty, and urgency.
    </p>

    <h2 id="alsos">Alsos Mission and Field Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Alsos units followed advancing fronts to assess—and arrest—the German nuclear effort. Reports and captured papers indicated a smaller, more fragmented program than feared. Beyond neutralising risks, Alsos built a documentary record that shaped Allied historiography, clarifying what Germany did—and did not—achieve by 1945.

    </div>

    <h2 id="statements">Public Statements of August 1945</h2>
    <p>
      The first public statements by Churchill, Truman, and Canadian ministers framed the weapon’s use and intent. Read together with technical annexes and postwar releases, they illuminate decision‑making, scientific credit, and the emerging narrative of deterrence and control.
    </p>

    <h2 id="legacy">Legacy for Policy and Scholarship</h2>
    <p>
      The atomic archive continues to inform debates on secrecy, alliance management, and civil–military relations. For students, reading the documents themselves remains indispensable, restoring nuance sometimes lost in later summaries.
