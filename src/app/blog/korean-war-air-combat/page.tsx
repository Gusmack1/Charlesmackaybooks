    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction: First Sustained Jet‑vs‑Jet War</h2>
    <p>The Korean War (1950–1953) delivered the first sustained jet‑vs‑jet fighting in history. Over the northwest of the Korean peninsula, in the sector that became known as MiG Alley, United Nations forces flying North American F‑86 Sabres met Soviet‑designed MiG‑15s flown by North Korean, Chinese, and, in key periods, Soviet pilots. The result was a proving ground for transonic aerodynamics, gunnery against swept‑wing targets, radar‑assisted ground control, and the logistics required to keep jet fighters in the air from forward bases.</p>

    <p>This aerial confrontation between East and West introduced new tactical doctrines, technologies, and pilot training methods that would define air combat for the next half-century. The lessons learned over Korea directly influenced Cold War aviation development and established the principles of supersonic fighter design.</p>

    <p>Korean War air combat proved that jet fighters would dominate future conflicts and demonstrated the critical importance of pilot training, aircraft performance, and technological superiority in determining air superiority. The war's air battles became the testing ground for jet age tactics that continue to influence modern air warfare.</p>

    <h2 id="context">Historical Context and Order of Battle</h2>
    <p>After early war phases dominated by piston types and ground attack, the arrival of the MiG‑15 in late 1950 posed a serious threat to high‑altitude UN bomber and reconnaissance operations. The F‑86 was fielded in strength to counter that threat. MiG Alley — roughly the area south of the Yalu River and west toward the Chongchon — became the principal arena for fighter combat. Ground‑controlled intercept (GCI) supported both sides: radar and radio nets vectoring formations toward advantageous positions, often at high altitude where transonic effects were prominent.</p>

    <h2 id="aircraft">Aircraft and Technical Profiles</h2>
    <h3 id="f86">North American F‑86 Sabre</h3>
    <p>Powered by a General Electric J47 turbojet, early F‑86 variants combined a 35° swept wing with automatic leading‑edge slats (on key versions) to improve low‑speed handling while preserving transonic performance. The gun battery typically comprised six .50‑inch Browning machine guns with high rate of fire and ample ammunition, harmonized for attacks against agile swept‑wing targets. Later blocks incorporated radar ranging gunsights to improve lethality during brief firing windows.</p>
    <h3 id="mig15">Mikoyan‑Gurevich MiG‑15</h3>
    <p>Using the Klimov VK‑1 centrifugal‑flow turbojet, the MiG‑15 featured a swept wing and high‑mounted tailplane that gave strong high‑altitude performance. Armament centered on heavy cannon — commonly one 37 mm and two 23 mm guns — optimized for bomber interception. The aircraft excelled in climb and initial acceleration, particularly above 30,000 feet, where tactics emphasized altitude advantage and slashing attacks.</p>

    <div class="bg-slate-800/60 border border-slate-700 rounded-lg p-6 my-6 surface-dark">
      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-4">Comparative Notes</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Altitude and Energy:</strong> MiG‑15 generally held the advantage above ~30,000 ft; F‑86 emphasized energy retention and slashing attacks when out‑climbed.</li>
        <li><strong>Armament:</strong> F‑86’s six .50‑inch guns offered high rate and flatter trajectory; MiG‑15’s mixed cannon brought heavy hits against larger, less agile targets.</li>
        <li><strong>Handling:</strong> F‑86 control harmony and slats aided close‑in maneuvering; MiG‑15’s initial acceleration and climb favored vertical tactics.</li>
        <li><strong>Sights and Avionics:</strong> Radar ranging gunsights improved F‑86 lethality in fleeting windows.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The propulsion system represented one of the most significant technical challenges. The requirements demanded power, reliability, and efficiency levels that pushed existing engine technology to its limits. The solution involved close collaboration between aircraft designers and engine manufacturers, resulting in powerplant innovations that would influence future aviation development.</p>

    <p>Structural design innovations were equally important. The need to combine strength with lightness required new approaches to aircraft construction. Engineers experimented with different materials, joint techniques, and structural configurations to achieve the optimal balance of performance characteristics.</p>

    <h2 id="operations">Operations and Logistics</h2>
    <p>Jet combat demanded reliable fuel quality, oxygen equipment, and engine maintenance cycles suitable for forward bases. Turnaround procedures, boresighting of guns, and inspections for compressor blade damage became routine. Air‑to‑air victories reflected not only pilot skill and aircraft performance but the steadiness of the ground organization that kept oxygen systems, sights, and engines within limits.</p>

    <h2 id="tactics">Tactics, Training, and Ground Control</h2>
    <p>Both sides used GCI to position fighters. UN tactics prioritized altitude blocks, mutual support, and energy management that exploited the F‑86’s control harmony and sighting systems. Opposing formations sought to fight where the MiG‑15’s strengths — climb and high‑altitude performance — were decisive. Training emphasized oxygen discipline, Mach awareness, and brief, accurate firing opportunities rather than prolonged chases.</p>

    <h2 id="accounts">Pilot Accounts and Combat Notes</h2>
    <p>Pilot debriefs emphasized altitude advantage, sun position, and teamwork. Reports noted that many encounters were decided in brief windows after the merge, where energy state and sight readiness mattered more than notional turn rates. Accounts of disengagement were as important as kills — disciplined break‑offs preserved forces to fight again under better terms.</p>

    <h2 id="impact-legacy">Impact and Legacy</h2>
    <p>The long-term impact of this development extends far beyond its immediate operational success. Its influence can be traced through subsequent generations of aircraft design, military doctrine, and aviation technology. The lessons learned during its development continue to inform modern aviation practice.</p>
