            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Reginald Joseph Mitchell's path to aviation immortality began with his work on high-speed seaplanes for the Schneider Trophy races. His experience with the S6 and S6B racing aircraft, which achieved world speed records, provided crucial knowledge about high-performance aerodynamics and the potential of liquid-cooled engines that would prove essential for fighter design.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Mitchell's design philosophy emphasized clean aerodynamics and structural efficiency. Unlike many contemporary aircraft that prioritized ease of construction, Mitchell pursued optimal performance through innovative solutions. His elliptical wing design for the Spitfire, inspired by his racing aircraft experience, would become one of the most recognizable and effective wing shapes in aviation history.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The transition from racing seaplanes to military fighters required fundamental changes in design priorities. Where racing aircraft needed speed for short durations, fighters required sustained performance, armament integration, and operational reliability. Mitchell's genius lay in adapting racing aircraft efficiency to military requirements without compromising the essential characteristics that made his designs exceptional.
