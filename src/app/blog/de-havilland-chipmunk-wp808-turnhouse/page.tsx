    <h2 id="historical-background">Historical Background: The Chipmunk's Development</h2>
    <p>
      The De Havilland Chipmunk was designed in the immediate post-war period as a replacement for the venerable Tiger Moth biplane trainer. The aircraft's development was driven by the need for a modern, all-metal trainer that could prepare pilots for the increasingly sophisticated aircraft entering RAF service. The transition from biplane to monoplane trainers represented a fundamental shift in training aircraft design philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designed by Wsiewołod Jakimiuk, a Polish engineer who had worked with De Havilland during the war, the Chipmunk incorporated lessons learned from wartime aircraft design. The aircraft featured a robust all-metal construction, excellent visibility from the tandem cockpit, and forgiving flight characteristics that made it ideal for primary flight training. Jakimiuk's design experience contributed significantly to the Chipmunk's success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chipmunk's first flight took place in 1946, and by 1950, it had entered RAF service as the standard primary trainer. Over the next four decades, the Chipmunk would train more than 100,000 pilots, making it one of the most successful training aircraft in aviation history. This comprehensive training record demonstrates the aircraft's effectiveness and reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of the Chipmunk occurred during a period of rapid change in British aviation. The transition from wartime to peacetime operations required new training approaches and aircraft. The Chipmunk's design reflected these changing requirements, incorporating modern construction techniques while maintaining the forgiving characteristics essential for training aircraft.
