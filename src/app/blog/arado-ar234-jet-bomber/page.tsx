    </p>

    <h2 id="design">Design Rationale and Airframe: Speed and Efficiency</h2>
    <p>
      Arado engineers conceived the Ar 234 initially as a fast photo-reconnaissance aircraft. The clean fuselage with a glazed nose housed a tightly packaged flight deck and cameras; the wing planform prioritised compressibility margins and structural efficiency for sustained high subsonic cruise. Early prototypes relied on a jettisonable take-off trolley (R-Gerät) and skid landing gear to save weight and drag, later replaced by a tricycle undercarriage in the Ar 234 B that transformed operational practicality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weight discipline was ruthless: fuel volume and mission kit were traded against speed and range with a clarity that presaged post-war jet design.

    </p>

    <h2 id="countermeasures">Countermeasures and Survivability: Speed as Defense</h2>
    <p>
      Survivability derived primarily from speed and altitude. Defensive guns were minimal or absent on many reconnaissance fits, reflecting the aircraft's doctrine: avoid interception altogether. Where opposition was encountered, Allied fighters struggled to achieve positional advantage in time. Anti-aircraft fire remained a risk on ingress/egress and over targets, mitigated by profile planning and speed.
    </p>
    <p>
