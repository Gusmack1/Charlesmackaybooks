    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      German fighter aviation evolved rapidly from scattered detachments to concentrated <em>Jagdgeschwader</em> formations. Organisational reform, aircraft flows, and tactical doctrine forged a culture that produced famous aces and unit identities. Understanding that structure—its logistics, leadership, and training—clarifies operational performance on the Western Front.

    <h2 id="reform">Von Hoeppner’s Reorganisation</h2>
    <p>
      Command reforms standardised fighter unit structures, clarified roles, and concentrated strength where needed. Documentation from the period shows how personnel flows, maintenance capacity, and replacement policies underwrote tactical results—just as much as airframe performance did.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tactics">Tactics, Training, and Aircraft</h2>
    <p>
      Early lessons emphasised altitude advantage, section discipline, and surprise. As Allied fighters improved, German units refined dive‑and‑climb attacks and team manoeuvre. Aircraft progression—from Albatros D‑types to Fokker designs—interacted with tactics and training to sustain competitiveness.
    </p>

    <h2 id="aces">The “Ace” and Unit Identity</h2>
    <p>
      The ace served as both tactical asset and cultural symbol. Unit markings, leadership styles, and claim systems reinforced cohesion. Yet records show the limits of individualism: sortie rates, serviceability, and staging often decided outcomes more than single combats.
    </p>

    <h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Post‑war analyses linked German organisational choices to later fighter doctrine: concentration of force, flexible tasking, and leadership pipelines. The lessons travel well beyond WWI.
