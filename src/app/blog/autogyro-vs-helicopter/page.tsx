    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Before the helicopter matured into a practical vertical-lift machine, the autogyro established the physics and confidence that made rotary-wing flight inevitable. Juan de la Cierva’s breakthrough with the freely articulating rotor—flapping and lead-lag hinges—tamed dissymmetry of lift and enabled safe autorotation, while pioneers like Igor Sikorsky transformed these insights into reliable powered hover. This article explains the aerodynamic differences, the overlapping technologies, and the evolutionary step from autorotative lift to controlled vertical flight.

    <h2 id="aerodynamics">Aerodynamics: Autorotation vs Powered Hover</h2>
    <p>
      Autogyros employ an unpowered rotor that spins due to air inflow through the disc during forward motion; a conventional propeller provides thrust. The advancing and retreating blades experience dissymmetry of lift, resolved by Cierva’s hinge systems and by cyclic variation of blade angle of attack. Helicopters, by contrast, power the rotor to produce lift and thrust, using collective and cyclic pitch to control magnitude and direction. Autorotation remains the helicopter’s emergency descent mode—proof that autogyro physics never left the stage.

    <h2 id="mechanics">Rotor Mechanics and Controls</h2>
    <p>
      The autogyro’s rotor, being unpowered, is mechanically simpler, but requires adequate forward airspeed for lift. Helicopters add transmission, swashplate, and anti-torque systems, raising complexity but unlocking vertical take-off and landing, hover, and lateral/vertical reposition without runway. Early helicopter pioneers exploited collective pitch to command rotor thrust and cyclic pitch to vector it, while tail rotors (or later, coaxial and NOTAR concepts) countered main-rotor torque.

    <h2 id="applications">Applications and Mission Profiles</h2>
    <p>
      Autogyros offered remarkable short-runway performance, slow-speed handling, and docile autorotative descent—excellent for liaison and observation. Helicopters multiplied these virtues by removing runway dependence: search and rescue, medevac, oil-rig support, shipborne logistics, and special operations all became routine. Military doctrine absorbed helicopters as utility lifters, gunships, and scout platforms; civil economies restructured supply chains around helilift.

    <h2 id="legacy">Legacy and Modern Variants</h2>
    <p>
      Modern autogyros survive as efficient sport and patrol aircraft; helicopters dominate vertical lift. The lineage is continuous: without Cierva’s rotors and the discipline of autorotation, Sikorsky’s powered rotorcraft would have lacked a safe descent mode and a practical envelope. Today’s rotorcraft research—coaxial, compound, tiltrotor—still balances the same forces Cierva and Sikorsky tamed.
