    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Avro Vulcan embodied the RAF’s early Cold War deterrent: a high-altitude, high-speed delta-wing bomber designed to deliver Britain’s strategic nuclear weapons. Its slender delta geometry conferred structural simplicity and high-speed stability; its avionics and crew systems evolved from analogue bombing-navigation suites to terrain-following aids and ECM packages as doctrine shifted from high-altitude penetration to low-level tactics.

    <h2 id="aerodynamics">Aerodynamics and Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The large delta wing distributed loads and fuel, offering high internal volume and a wide centre-of-gravity envelope. At altitude, the delta’s characteristics supported efficient cruise; at low level, the wing demanded careful energy management but proved robust. Elevons provided combined pitch/roll control, while the fin and rudder stabilised the vast planform.

    <h2 id="propulsion">Propulsion and Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Rolls-Royce Avon and later Olympus turbojets powered successive variants. Systems modernisation included inertial navigation, Doppler radar, electronic countermeasures, and in later years, terrain-following procedures to minimise radar exposure. Crew coordination in the pressurised cabin integrated navigation, bombing, and ECM roles into a tightly choreographed workflow.

    <h2 id="doctrine">Doctrine: From High Altitude to Low Level</h2>
    <p>
      Initially intended to transit and attack at high altitude, the Vulcan’s survivability at those profiles diminished as Soviet SAMs matured. The RAF transformed doctrine toward low-level ingress, trading fuel economy for terrain masking. The Black Buck raids in the Falklands era demonstrated long-range conventional reach when supported by extensive air-to-air refuelling.
    </p>

    <h2 id="legacy">Legacy and Cultural Memory</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond deterrence, the Vulcan’s public displays showcased delta aesthetics and British engineering. As a technology bridge, it linked analogue navigation-bombing paradigms to later digital strike aircraft. Its legacy survives in airshow memories, museum exhibits, and the historical record of independent nuclear deterrent policy.
