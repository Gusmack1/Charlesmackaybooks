    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction: The Jet Age and Cold War Imperative</h2>
    <p>The Jet Age transformed air power from piston‑engine mass to turbine‑powered speed, altitude, and missile integration. From late‑WWII prototypes to mature Cold War weapon systems, the arc of development fused aerodynamics, engines, sensors, and doctrine. This Enhanced Edition traces that arc with emphasis on British and allied experience — from Me 262 and Meteor to Sabre/MiG parity, then to supersonic interceptors like the English Electric Lightning — showing how technology and strategy co‑evolved.</p>

      <p class="text-sm mt-2 text-center italic">From experimental jets to frontline service: the turbine displaced the piston in less than a decade.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="foundations">Foundations: Late‑War Jets</h2>
    <p>The German Me 262 demonstrated operational jet fighter viability; Britain’s Meteor entered service to counter V‑1s; the U.S. P‑80 set the American baseline. Early centrifugal‑flow engines (Whittle lineage) offered simplicity and ruggedness; axial‑flow engines promised higher pressure ratios and efficiency but demanded metallurgical advances. Airframe design wrestled with compressibility: straight wings limited transonic performance; sweep delayed critical Mach.</p>

    <h2 id="sweep">Sweep, Stability, and Flight Controls</h2>
    <p>Adoption of swept wings (35° class) on types like F‑86 and MiG‑15 elevated transonic capability. Automatic slats (Sabre) restored low‑speed manners; all‑moving tails (F‑86E, later supersonic types) addressed shock‑induced pitch issues. British research at Farnborough and allied wind‑tunnel programmes converged on solutions that defined second‑generation jets.</p>

      <p class="text-sm mt-2 text-center italic">Sweep delays compressibility; the all‑flying tail restores pitch authority near and beyond Mach 1.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="engines">Engines: From Centrifugal to Axial, and to Reheat</h2>
    <p>Post‑war, Britain led with centrifugal‑flow (Derwent, Nene) before transitioning to axial (Avon, Sapphire). Reheat (afterburning) added thrust for climb and dash, indispensable for interceptors like the Lightning. Materials science — turbine blade alloys, cooling, and coatings — unlocked reliability needed for QRA and maritime conditions.</p>

    <h2 id="sensors">Sensors and Weapons: Radar and IR Missiles</h2>
    <p>Air‑intercept radar matured from ranging sets to track‑while‑scan capabilities; IR missiles (Firestreak → Red Top; AIM‑9 Sidewinder) shifted the weapons mix from guns to guided weapons. British Ferranti AI.23 enabled the Lightning’s day/night intercept role; NATO doctrine knitted ground control, datalinks, and onboard sensors into a coherent kill chain.</p>

    <h2 id="doctrine">Doctrine: Point Defence vs Continental Shield</h2>
    <p>Britain’s geography favoured point‑defence interceptors with rapid climb and limited endurance (Lightning). The U.S. and Canada built continental shields (F‑102/F‑106, BOMARC) with heavier radars and longer legs. France’s Mirage III showed that a multirole supersonic fighter could satisfy export and national needs simultaneously. Each solution optimised for threat, terrain, and budget.</p>

      <p class="text-sm mt-2 text-center italic">Cold War theatre: intercept photographs were diplomacy by other means.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="britain">Britain’s Path: Meteor → Hunter → Lightning</h2>
    <p>Britain’s progression moved from Meteor’s jet initiation, through Hawker Hunter’s elegant transonic performance, to Lightning’s Mach‑2 point defence. The Hunter refined gunnery and high‑altitude handling; the Lightning fused reheat climb, AI.23 radar, and IR missiles into a tightly integrated QRA system. The trade‑off — short endurance — was managed by basing and procedures.</p>

    <h2 id="alliances">Alliances, Exports, and Standardisation</h2>
    <p>NATO operated a tapestry of types: Sabres, Starfighters, Mirages, Lightnings. Common training and maintenance standards evolved, spreading tactics and safety practices. Licensed production (Canadair, Fiat/Lockheed) embedded industrial capacity across allies, accelerating upgrades and spares flows.</p>

    <h2 id="legacy">Legacy: From Gunfighters to Integrated Systems</h2>
    <p>By the late 1960s, the Jet Age delivered integrated air weapons systems: radar, missiles, ECM, and navigation tied to doctrine and basing. The lessons — engineer for the threat envelope; integrate sensors with weapons; prioritise maintainability — persist in modern quick‑reaction fleets.</p>
