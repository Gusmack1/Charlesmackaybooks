          <div className="prose prose-lg prose-slate max-w-none mb-8">
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              HMS Argus began life as the Italian passenger liner Conte Rosso, laid down in 1914 for the Lloyd Sabaudo line. The outbreak of World War I halted construction, creating an opportunity that would prove crucial for naval aviation development. The incomplete hull presented the Royal Navy with a chance to experiment with radical aircraft carrier concepts without the constraints of existing ship designs.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The decision to convert Conte Rosso into an aircraft carrier represented a massive leap of faith for the Admiralty. No precedent existed for such a conversion, and many naval officers remained skeptical about the military value of aircraft operations at sea. The project required innovative engineering solutions and challenged fundamental assumptions about naval architecture and operations.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Beardmore's shipyard undertook the complex conversion work, transforming a passenger liner into history's first true aircraft carrier. The conversion required removing all superstructure to create an unobstructed flight deck, relocating the bridge and funnel arrangements, and developing entirely new systems for aircraft operations. Every aspect of the conversion broke new ground in naval engineering.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The innovative design featured a 550-foot flight deck completely clear of obstructions - a revolutionary concept that would become the standard for all future aircraft carriers. This flush deck design maximized aircraft operating space while simplifying landing and takeoff procedures, establishing principles that remain fundamental to carrier operations today.

          <div className="prose prose-lg prose-slate max-w-none mb-8">
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The technical challenges of creating HMS Argus required unprecedented innovation in naval architecture. The flush flight deck design necessitated creative solutions for bridge placement, funnel arrangements, and aircraft handling systems. Engineers had to balance aircraft operational requirements with basic ship functionality and safety.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The signature funnel arrangement became one of Argus's most distinctive features. To maintain the clear flight deck, the ship's funnel could be lowered during flight operations, earning the vessel the nickname "Flat Iron." This innovative system allowed continuous aircraft operations while providing necessary ventilation for the ship's machinery spaces.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Aircraft handling systems required entirely new approaches to storage, movement, and maintenance. The ship featured a hangar deck below the flight deck with elevator systems to move aircraft between levels. These innovations established the basic layout that would be refined and adopted by all subsequent aircraft carrier designs worldwide.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Landing and takeoff procedures had to be developed from scratch, as no established techniques existed for carrier operations. Early experiments with various arresting gear systems and deck configurations provided crucial data that influenced decades of subsequent carrier development. Every landing taught valuable lessons about aircraft-ship integration.
