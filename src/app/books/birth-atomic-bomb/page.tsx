The chronicle of its manufacture, its use against Japan and how it was installed in the Boeing B-29 Superfortress in "Silverplate." These are the first published statements by the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States in August 1945. "The British deserve much of the credit for the Atomic Bombâ€”their research was way ahead of ours when the project was turned over to the United States to develop because our laboratories and manufacturing facilities were out of range of bombing and it was the Prime Minister who sold the idea of pushing the project to both the British and United States Governments." - W. Averell Harriman, United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, 7th August 1945.`,
