  description: `HMS Argus was the world's true aircraft carrier with a flat deck, this concept being planned by the Marquis of Montrose a Beardmore director. Built as the emigrant carrier SS Conte Rosso for the Italian Line Lloyd Sabuado at Dalmuir, Scotland, in 1914, the vessel was ultimately bought by the Admiralty in 1916. She was launched in December 1917 as HMS Argus. By 1918 she was redesigned and sailed in September 1918 for Burntisland for trials with aircraft on the first carrier landings and take off with Sopwith aircraft including Pups. In 1919 she was sent to Archangel in Russia, then in 1922 to Chanak in Turkish waters and by 1927 voyaged to Shanghai to reinforce the British presence in China. Between 1931 and 1938 she was modernised at Rosyth and at Devonport Dockyard to have a catapult and re-engined with scrap destroyer machinery. (The destroyers have been identified.). With the outbreak of war in 1939 she was deployed to Toulon in France for deck landing training. She was also deployed in the Firth of Clyde for deck landing training. One of her instructor's was the celebrated test-pilot Eric "Winkle" Brown.`,
