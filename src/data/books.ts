In this second volume of This was the Enemy, the procurement of aircraft, bombs, aeroplane details and aircraft armament are explored. It is astonishing to discover the myriad of production plans, confusion of detail and cancelled projects embarked by the Nazis. Hitler had the knack of appointing through Goering, the wrong people for the wrong jobs at the wrong time. An example of this appointment was Ernst Udet.
This volume follows German Aeronautical and Armaments Industry from its rise in 1934 to its collapse in 1945. Chapter one covers the planning of the aircraft industry guided by Erhard Milch and shows the collapse of pre-war theory. Chapter two introduces aircraft procurement to the destruction  of aircraft production due to Allied bombing. The research details are covered from the Bombing Command Survey Unit and the United States Strategic Survey Unit.
There is a chapter covering front line German Air Force aircraft, each aircraft is supported by a myriad of pictures and technical drawings.
Armament shows the work of Rheinmetall Borsig and Mauser. All classes of bombs are illustrated with technical drawings. The appendix closes with the Blohm unt Voss asymmetrical aircraft.

Not a compilation of internet articles but newly researched using original documents from the period. Probably for the first time a complete list of aeroplanes transferred to the Americans at the Armistice. In August 1914 there were 12 German aircraft companies manufacturing aeroplanes. By 1918 there were 33 aircraft manufacturers and the companies employed 60000 workers. At the time of the Armistice the German aircraft industry had manufactured in total between 48000 and 49000 aeroplanes. As part of an expansion programme the army depended heavily on captive balloons for aerial observation. In 1916 the German air service was reorganized by Ernst von Hoeppner. At that time he introduced fighter wings to counteract the Entente aerial forces giving rise to the "Ace." Using captured documents, newly translated, Flying for Kaiser Wilhelm, describes the wartime situation and the sudden fall of Germany on the Western Front. With the collapse in November 1918, Germany lost the war, her Emperor and Crown Prince and endured a draconian Armistice. Contents: 1. Biographies and illustrations of Pour le Merite (Blue Max) pilots, includes Udet and Goring. 2. Armament - Spandau and Parabellum. German aerial bombs with diagrams. 3. Training methods for observers, mechanics and pilots. Lists training air bases, aircraft companies, spares production and military flying schools. 4.

The book describes his flying at Auchensail, Wallaceton Cardross and in England. There is a history of Cardross with a weather description for 1895 and 1896. His experimental work was influenced by Lilienthal, the great German aircraft pioneer, whom he met twice. He was also in contact with the Australian Hargrave, Octave Chanute in America and was employed by Hiram Maxim of Vickers machine-gun fame. The Wright Brothers used his data when constructing the Wright Flyer. He displayed his Hawk, which killed him, at Kelvingrove Park and Prof Square, University of Glasgow. The Pilcher Hawk still exists today in Edinburgh. Pilcher sailed his yachts on the Firth of Clyde and this aspect of his life is fully explored. His two yachts were Gleam and Widow. Gleam was built by the Herreshoff Brothers in America and Widow built by John Paul & Son, Gourock. Herreshoff and John Paul are covered extensively in the appendix. John Herreshoff sailed on the Firth of Clyde out of Gourock and met Pilcher. Percy Sinclair Pilcher lectured at the University of Glasgow and some of his presentations are here described. His sister was instrumental in building the wings and saw him fall to his death like Icarus in September 1899. His death is supported by the Coroner\'s report and conclusions. There is a profuse Bibliography and appendix. Printed on high quality paper making it very heavy. Highly recommended in a very limited run.',

    description: 'A rare insight into the British Furniture industry in peace and war. First based in Newcastle to furnish the Vickers liners the company moved to Glasgow, Scotland, in 1914. For over seventy years the company had been associated with furniture of distinction and of being at the forefront of innovation. Their wartime history was war winning being involved with Highball and Upkeep spherical mines/bombs, the Cierva Air Horse. the Rotachute and the Rotabuggy and later the Vickers Trans Sonic Missile. Initially the company furnished ships and hotels such as Gleneagles and Turnberry then the liners Empress of Britain, Aquitania, Pendennis Castle, Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth etc. Furnishing the Queen Mary was the largest furnishing contract given in the shipbuilding industry at the time in 1932. The company furnished the liners for Canadian Pacific such as the Empress of Britain, Empress of Japan and the Empress of France and continued into the fifties. Furnishing liners lasted till the launching of the Queen Elizabeth 2 at Clydebank in the late sixties. Morris developed the British helicopter with Weir and Cierva including the Flying Jeep and the single - seat rotorcraft called the Rotachute. They also manufactured the interiors for the Beardmore taxi and the Bennie Railplane. They supplied the blades for the Bristol Sycamore and the Bristol 192. The helicopter development by Morris is covered in "The Sycamore Seeds," ISBN-10: 0957344333 ISBN-13: 978-0957344334. During World War 2 the company became part of the Royal Aircraft Establishment doing model work on such aircraft as the SRA1 jet flying boat. They produced 77 Highball casings (Bouncing bomb for 618 Squadron) and worked with the Americans in producing heavy bombs such as Tallboy, Grand slam and the biggest of all the giant 44000lb. Morris completing all the model work.They were involved with the production of Upkeep and the Dambuster raid. For the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment, Helensburgh, they produced models and a catapult. The company also furnished the crack King George V battleship, H.M.S. Duke of York, the cruiser HMS Fiji and the Polish destroyer Piorun. The Duke of York\'s furniture was passed to the USS Missouri and used as part of the surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay in 1945. The company also manufactured models for the Brabazon Committee. In addition to working on the Spitfire and Hurricane, the company worked on the Mosquito producing the balsa plywood for the airframe, Morris held the patent for the Balsa plywood. Morris also producing a batch of "Queen Bee" drones for Scottish Aviation. The Queen Bee flying in the United Kingdom is one of this batch. Morris also produced aircraft wood and the wings and tail for the group built Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle bomber/transport. Nearly a million Lee – Enfield rifles were produced in conjunction with Singers and Albion Motors. Examples of the rifle furniture, such as rifle buts, can be found on EBay. They also produced a wooden engine for Frank Whittler\'s Power Jets. After the war Morris was involved in all displays including Britain Can Make It, the Scottish Furniture Fair, the Festival of Britain 1951 and the annual Modern Homes Exhibition. After the crash of the Cierva Air Horse heavy lift helicopter the company left aircraft manufacturing to concentrate on volume furniture. They did produce a final of 5V3 Aeroply for Scottish Aviation in 1951 for the Dakota aircraft. The company has never been owned by Scottish Aviation and such reports are historically very inaccurate. The Royal Yacht Britannia was also furnished by Morris as was the battleship HMS Vanguard and the substitute Royal Yacht SS Gothic for visits by the Royal Family to South Africa and Australia. Their most famous set of furniture is the Cumbrae Range which swept away Utility furniture. The company also refurbished Clarence House for Princess Elizabeth and Prince Phillip on the occasion of their wedding. The Cloud Table, designed by Neil B. Morris, (some available on EBay) created a sensation due to its distinctive shape and size in the post-war era. Shavings for Breakfast takes the company from 1914 to 1975 and is profusely illustrated with many pictures never before published and shows the production process for the Lee Enfield Rifle, the Vickers Transonic Missile progenitor of Blue Steel, the company completed the model work for the MAEE and the wooden aircraft propellers for the Rolls - Royce Merlin and Griffon. Shavings for Breakfast is probably the first modern furniture book to combine furnishing of ships and hotels, the Russian furniture industry, plywood manufacture and government policy towards the industry. Shavings for Breakfast is highly recommended giving an authoritive insight into the British furniture industry. Profusely illustrated with black and white illustrations with drawings and diagrams. Most never before published such as an image of the SS Empress of Britain on fire and the shipbuilder James Lithgow. There are also diagrams of the American Bouncing Bomb, the production cycle of manufacturing the Lee Enfield rifle wooden parts, Women making furniture and glider parts, assembly of Hurricane PZ865, "The last of the Many," etc. This is an historical document, the company has ceased making all furniture and this is now the only source book for furniture manufacturing in print from 1884 to 1975. This is not a compilation of internet articles or a print on demand book. Shavings for Breakfast has been originally researched and printed in the United Kingdom and comes highly recommended for the student and general reader alike.',

    description: 'The original story of the Atomic bomb, its invention and deployment. The chronicle of its manufacture, its use against Japan and how it was installed in the Boeing B-29 Superfortress in "Silverplate." These are the first published statements by the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States in August 1945. "The British deserve much of the credit for the Atomic Bomb—their research was way ahead of ours when the project was turned over to the United States to develop because our laboratories and manufacturing facilities were out of range of bombing and it was the Prime Minister who sold the idea of pushing the project to both the British and United States Governments." W. Averell Harriman, United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, 7th August 1945. 1945 Statements on the Atomic Bomb includes all aspects of the ALSOS Mission, Canada, United States and the German Atomic Bomb. ISBN: 9780957344396. Condition New. 192 Pages, A5 - 66 black and white pictures with three drawings including a 3 view drawing of a B-29. The cover shows the cockpit view from a B-29 based at Tinian in 1945. Dispatched with Royal Mail 2nd Class. These are newly restored statements from lost documents published by the Allies in August 1945 on the development and deployment of the Atomic Bomb. The book includes statements on ALSOS, M.A.U.D., Quebec Agreement, Chickenpox, Silverplate etc. The book explains what Silverplate, Chickenpox etc. in terms of atomic weapons deployment. The restored documents are:- 1. Statements relating to the Atomic Bomb - Winston Churchill 1945. This described the formation of "Tube Alloys" and its integration with the American Manhattan District/Project. 2. Report on the use of Uranium for a Bomb (M.A.U.D. Committee/M.A.U.D. Report) with drawings. 3. Quebec Agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.(Still in force today.) 4. Statement by C.D. Howe, Canadian Minister. 5. Statement by the Office of the Minister of Reconstruction Ottawa, Canada.(Lists all the Allied atomic scientists). 6. Harry S. Truman - Statement by the President of the United States. 7. Statement on the Bombing of Japan by Henry Stimson. 8. Silverplate - the development of the Atom bomb carrying B-29 Superfortress, their fate and deployment. The word Silverplate refers to the modifications of the Superfortress to carry the atomic bomb. 9. ALSOS Mission - the inspection of the Nazi Germany capability to produce atomic weapons and the mythological work of Heisenberg and Nazi ideology. Includes drawings of the proposed German Atomic Bomb. 10. Peppermint - the preparation of the Allies for the deployment by the Nazis of nuclear products for the invasion of Europe. 11. Chickenpox - the American preparations for the deployment of atomic bombs in aircraft post - war. 12. Statement by J.R. Oppenheimer - on the deployment of British Scientists on the Manhattan Project. There are fresh details of British scientists working on the Atomic Bomb project at Los Alamos by Oppenheimer including Groves and Chadwick. The Alsos chapter includes details of Joliet Currie, Heisenberg and the German scientists which are rarely published. The official conclusion of this chapter is that the Nazis could never have produced an Atomic Bomb and prepares the reader for the post-war propaganda that the German scientists tried to delay the Bomb\'s production or that one was in preparation for use. From these statements it can be deduced that the first uranium bomb, dropped in August 1945 was based on the British M.A.U.D. technology. The Statements are from Harry Truman, United States, Winston S. Churchill (for the first time published in its entirety since 1945 "Statements Relating to the Atomic Bomb"), United Kingdom and C.D. Howe for Canada. There are scientist lists and details of Fat Man and Little Boy Atomic Bombs. These documents are of great historical value since neither nation repeated their publication on the birth of the bomb. These are the source documents for all atomic bomb publications and were part of "Sonic to Standoff" which can be found in EBay.co.uk. 1945 Statements on the Atomic Bomb presents all the Allied documents co-ordinated in one volume and is highly recommended.',

    description: 'HMS Argus was the world\'s true aircraft carrier with a flat deck, this concept being planned by the Marquis of Montrose a Beardmore director. Built as the emigrant carrier SS Conte Rosso for the Italian Line Lloyd Sabuado at Dalmuir, Scotland, in 1914, the vessel was ultimately bought by the Admiralty in 1916. She was launched in December 1917 as HMS Argus. By 1918 she was redesigned and sailed in September 1918 for Burntisland for trials with aircraft on the first carrier landings and take off with Sopwith aircraft including Pups. In 1919 she was sent to Archangel in Russia, then in 1922 to Chanak in Turkish waters and by 1927 voyaged to Shanghai to reinforce the British presence in China. Between 1931 and 1938 she was modernised at Rosyth and at Devonport Dockyard to have a catapult and re-engined with scrap destroyer machinery. (The destroyers have been identified.). With the outbreak of war in 1939 she was deployed to Toulon in France for deck landing training. She was also deployed in the Firth of Clyde for deck landing training. One of her instructor\'s was the celebrated test-pilot Eric "Winkle" Brown. His story is here, Captain of the Clouds, Test Pilot Captain Eric Winkle Brown a Biography. In Operation Benedict she supplied Russia with Hurricanes. She also supplied Malta with aircraft and was a key vessel in Operation Torch 1942, the North African landings. Argus providing cover for the eastern landings. There she was attacked by Vichy French submarines. Some of these voyages were dubbed, "Club Runs." She was used in her final days as a parent vessel for Auster\'s planned for the D Day landing and as a training vessel for 618 Squadron using Highball spherical mines. The history of HMS Argus is linked closely with the deployment of aircraft at sea by the Royal Navy and the Fleet Air Arm and this ship history includes deck flying to 1914. Included are details of the French seaplane vessel Foudre. The Argus carrier concept was also incorporated into H.M.S. Audacity and Audacity\'s plans were given to the U.S. Navy and resulted in the C.V. USS Long Island resulting in the jeep carriers of WW2. This 175 page highly detailed book, with 330 illustrations, including restored ship covers, traces her history and wartime record in the Royal Navy, to her demolition at Inverkeithing in 1947. This is a tribute to her launching in 1917 at Dalmuir and to her demolition in Fife by 1947. Included is an image of her demolition at Inverkeithing. This is not a collection of internet or Wikipedia articles but a companion to the ever popular "Beardmore Aviation" and is highly recommended. Originally researched and published.',

The illustrations are in colour or of contemporary prints in black and white. All images have been restored and are fresh and clear and complement the text and can only be found in this book. Now in its seventh reprint due to popularity. Dorothy Wordsworth starts in the borders. Goes to the grave of Robert Burns. Travels through Leadhills to Glasgow. She mixes well with the people. Visits Dumbarton Castle and sees a huge fish in the garrison. She then heads for the Highlands. Visits Luss. She is one of the first to travel over the "Rest and be Thankful." She goes round Inverary and visits the castle grounds. Heads for Glen Coe where she visits the King\'s House hotel and stays at the Inveroran Hotel. At the hotel she meets the Highland drovers. In a walk with Coleridge and her brother William, they meet a Highland Chief near Loch Katrine and the family of Rob Roy McGregor. She visits Rosslyn Chapel and finally meets Walter Scott as she crosses the border to return home. She travels over 600 miles in six weeks. Each week has its own section covering her travels. Extract from the week with the Highland Folk: "Encouraged by the sweetness of her manners, I went down-stairs to dry my feet by the kitchenfire; she lent me a pair of stockings, and behaved to me with the utmostattention and kindness. She carried the tea-things into the room herself,leaving me to make tea, and set before us cheese and butter and barley cakes.These cakes are as thin as our oat-bread, but, instead of being crisp, are softand leathery, yet we, being hungry, and the butter delicious, ate them withgreat pleasure, but when the same bread was set before us afterwards we did notlike it. After tea William and I walked out; weamused ourselves with watching the Highlanders at work: they went leisurelyabout everything, and whatever was to be done, all followed, old men, andyoung, and little children. We were driven into the house by a shower, whichcame on with the evening darkness, and the people leaving their work paused atthe same time. I was pleased to see them a while after sitting round a blazingfire in the kitchen, father and son-in-law, master and man, and the mother withher little child on her knee. When I had been there before tea I had observedwhat a contrast there was between the mistress and her kitchen; she did notdiffer in appearance from an English country lady; but her kitchen, roof,Avails, and floor of mud, was all black alike; yet now, with the light of abright fire upon so many happy countenances, the whole room made a pretty sight." Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland 1803 is indeed a recollection for Dorothy lost her notes and composed the text from memory. So much so her brother William Wordsworth used Dorothy\'s text for his own compositions. Its here you will find the poem "Solitary Reaper," set in its true Highland context. The cover shows the falls at Inversnaid. The waterfall is down from the Inversnaid Hotel and flows into Loch Lomond. The photograph was taken at the site from Dorothy\'s description. Even today the description is very accurate. The topography that Dorothy and William Wordsworth travelled is very much the same as it is today. Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland 1803 is designed to be handy and fit into a bag or case whilst travelling around Scotland or the Borders.
