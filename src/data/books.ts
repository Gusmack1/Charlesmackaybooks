    description: 'Scotland’s most ambitious engineering house went airborne. Beardmore Aviation took the skills of shipbuilding and heavy industry and applied them to cutting‑edge aircraft, engines and airships – from Sopwith shipboard fighters and the mighty Handley Page bombers to the world‑changing HMS Argus, the first true flat‑deck aircraft carrier. Drawing directly on company archives, Admiralty papers and factory drawings, this definitive history shows how a Glasgow industrial giant helped invent modern naval aviation and pushed all‑metal construction forward.\n\nInside you\'ll find: the complete Beardmore aircraft family (W.B. series) and the Inflexible; the Typhoon/Cyclone/Tornado engines that powered airships (including the R101 programme); deck‑landing trials and carrier operations; production totals, contracts and rare photographs rescued from the works.\n\nPerfect for researchers and enthusiasts alike, this is the missing industrial chapter in British aviation – meticulously sourced, richly illustrated and written for readers who want the facts and the drama.

By 1913, the company had established itself as a major shipbuilder and steel manufacturer on the River Clyde.
