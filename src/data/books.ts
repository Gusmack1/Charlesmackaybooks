The Luftwaffe met its match in the Royal Air Force and actions from Norway to the Battle of Britain in September 1940 are fully described. The aircraft companies are mentioned as is the development of the German piston aero-engine and Gas Turbines. This includes Jumo, BMW and Heinkel Hirth gas turbines and the failed work of von Ohain and Max Hahn. The appendix covers armament and the U-234 being captured with Ulrich Kessler in the Atlantic in May 1943 and Heinkel with his Nazi tendencies.

    description: 'Flying for Kaiser Wilhelm 1914-1918. Clean and unmarked straight off the press published 12 July 2023, Volume Two of German Aircraft in the Great War. Not a compilation of internet articles but newly researched using original documents from the period. Probably for the first time a complete list of aeroplanes transferred to the Americans at the Armistice. In August 1914 there were 12 German aircraft companies manufacturing aeroplanes. By 1918 there were 33 aircraft manufacturers and the companies employed 60000 workers. At the time of the Armistice the German aircraft industry had manufactured in total between 48000 and 49000 aeroplanes. As part of an expansion programme the army depended heavily on captive balloons for aerial observation. In 1916 the German air service was reorganized by Ernst von Hoeppner. At that time he introduced fighter wings to counteract the Entente aerial forces giving rise to the "Ace." Using captured documents, newly translated, Flying for Kaiser Wilhelm, describes the wartime situation and the sudden fall of Germany on the Western Front. With the collapse in November 1918, Germany lost the war, her Emperor and Crown Prince and endured a draconian Armistice.',

For over seventy years the company had been associated with furniture of distinction and of being at the forefront of innovation. Their wartime history was war winning being involved with Highball and Upkeep spherical mines/bombs, the Cierva Air Horse, the Rotachute and the Rotabuggy and later the Vickers Trans Sonic Missile. Initially the company furnished ships and hotels such as Gleneagles and Turnberry then the liners Empress of Britain, Aquitania, Pendennis Castle, Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth etc. Furnishing the Queen Mary was the largest furnishing contract given in the shipbuilding industry at the time in 1932. The company furnished the liners for Canadian Pacific such as the Empress of Britain, Empress of Japan and the Empress of France and continued into the fifties. Furnishing liners lasted till the launching of the Queen Elizabeth 2 at Clydebank in the late sixties.',
