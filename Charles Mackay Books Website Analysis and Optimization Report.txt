# Charles Mackay Books Website Analysis and Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

While the specific website URLs provided (charlesmackaybooks.com and the GitHub repository Gusmack1/Charlesmackaybooks) were not publicly accessible for direct analysis, this comprehensive report provides expert solutions for the described CSS white-on-white text issue and broader e-commerce optimization opportunities. **The primary issue appears to be CSS specificity conflicts causing shipping information to inherit white text color on white backgrounds**, a common problem with cascading style inheritance and conflicting CSS rules.

Based on extensive research, this report delivers specific AI prompts for Cursor AI that address CSS conflicts, e-commerce optimization, and code quality improvements. The solutions are designed to resolve immediate visibility issues while establishing long-term optimization frameworks.

## CSS White-on-White Text Issue Analysis

The shipping information visibility problem stems from common CSS cascade and specificity conflicts. The affected text elements ("üì¶ Royal Mail Shipping", "Book Weight: 378g", shipping prices, and delivery messaging) are likely inheriting white text colors from parent containers or being overridden by theme/plugin CSS with higher specificity.

### Root Causes Identified

**CSS Specificity Wars**: Multiple stylesheets competing for control over text colors, with shipping elements caught in inheritance chains that apply white text on white backgrounds. **CSS Framework Conflicts**: Theme CSS, normalize/reset stylesheets, and custom styles creating cascade conflicts. **Dynamic Content Issues**: Shipping calculators and e-commerce plugins injecting conflicting styles without proper scoping.
