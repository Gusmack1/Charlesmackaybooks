"It is a remarkable piece of scholarship and does Percy justice." recent review

"We have a little information about Percy Pilcher, but nothing as comprehensive and well researched as this, so it is a wonderful addition to stock. His story is both fascinating and tragic - one can't help wondering how the development of flight would have progressed had he survived." - local history archive.

"The falling scene is brutal to read. I reallyfelt him through the words." recent review.

Modern Furniture Shavings for Breakfast: the Morris Furniture Company.
¬£12.86 ISBN 9780957344310

A rare insight into the British Furniture industry in peace and war.

First based in Newcastle to furnish the Vickers liners the company moved to Glasgow, Scotland, in 1914. For over seventy years the company had been associated with furniture of distinction and of being at the forefront of innovation. Their wartime history was war winning being involved with Highball and Upkeep spherical mines/bombs, the Cierva Air Horse. the Rotachute and the Rotabuggy and later the Vickers Trans Sonic Missile.

‚Ä¢ Initially the company furnished ships and hotels such as Gleneagles and Turnberry then the liners Empress of Britain, Aquitania, Pendennis Castle, Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth etc. Furnishing the Queen Mary was the largest furnishing contract given in the shipbuilding industry at the time in 1932. The company furnished the liners for Canadian Pacific such as the Empress of Britain, Empress of Japan and the Empress of France and continued into the fifties. Furnishing liners lasted till the launching of the Queen Elizabeth 2 at Clydebank in the late sixties.

‚Ä¢ Morris developed the British helicopter with Weir and Cierva including the Flying Jeep and the single - seat rotorcraft called the Rotachute. They also manufactured the interiors for the Beardmore taxi and the Bennie Railplane. They supplied the blades for the Bristol Sycamore and the Bristol 192. The helicopter development by Morris is covered in "The Sycamore Seeds," ISBN-10: 0957344333 ISBN-13: 978-0957344334

‚Ä¢ During World War 2 the company became part of the Royal Aircraft Establishment doing model work on such aircraft as the SRA1 jet flying boat. They produced 77 Highball casings (Bouncing bomb for 618 Squadron) and worked with the Americans in producing heavy bombs such as Tallboy, Grand slam and the biggest of all the giant 44000lb. Morris completing all the model work.They were involved with the production of Upkeep and the Dambuster raid. For the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment, Helensburgh, they produced models and a catapult.  The company also furnished the crack King George V battleship, H.M.S. Duke of York, the cruiser HMS Fiji and the Polish destroyer Piorun. The Duke of York's furniture was passed to the USS Missouri and used as part of the surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay in 1945. The company also manufactured models for the Brabazon Committee.

‚Ä¢ In addition to working on the Spitfire and Hurricane, the company worked on the Mosquito producing the balsa plywood for the airframe, Morris held the patent for the Balsa plywood. Morris also producing a batch of "Queen Bee" drones for Scottish Aviation. The Queen Bee flying in the United Kingdom is one of this batch.

Morris also produced aircraft wood and the wings and tail for the group built Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle bomber/transport. Nearly a million Lee ‚Äì Enfield rifles were produced in conjunction with Singers and Albion Motors. Examples of the rifle furniture, such as rifle buts, can be found on EBay. They also produced a wooden engine for Frank Whittler's Power Jets.

‚Ä¢ After the war Morris was involved in all displays including Britain Can Make It, the Scottish Furniture Fair, the Festival of Britain 1951 and the annual Modern Homes Exhibition.

‚Ä¢ After the crash of the Cierva Air Horse heavy lift helicopter the company left aircraft manufacturing to concentrate on volume furniture. They did produce a final of 5V3 Aeroply for Scottish Aviation in 1951 for the Dakota aircraft. The company has never been owned by Scottish Aviation and such reports are historically very inaccurate.

‚Ä¢ The Royal Yacht Britannia was also furnished by Morris as was the battleship HMS Vanguard and the substitute Royal Yacht SS Gothic for visits by the Royal Family to South Africa and Australia. Their most famous set of furniture is the Cumbrae Range which swept away Utility furniture. The company also refurbished Clarence House for Princess Elizabeth and Prince Phillip on the occasion of their wedding.

‚Ä¢ The Cloud Table, designed by Neil B. Morris, (some available on EBay) created a sensation due to its distinctive shape and size in the post-war era.

‚Ä¢ Shavings for Breakfast takes the company from 1914 to 1975 and is profusely illustrated with many pictures never before published and shows the production process for the Lee Enfield Rifle, the Vickers Transonic Missile progenitor of Blue Steel, the company completed the model work for the MAEE and the wooden aircraft propellers for the Rolls - Royce Merlin and Griffon.

‚Ä¢ Shavings for Breakfast is probably the first modern furniture book to combine furnishing of ships and hotels, the Russian furniture industry, plywood manufacture and government policy towards the industry. Shavings for Breakfast is highly recommended giving an authoritive insight into the British furniture industry

Profusely illustrated with black and white illustrations with drawings and diagrams. Most never before published such as an image of the SS Empress of Britain on fire and the shipbuilder James Lithgow.  There are also diagrams of the American Bouncing Bomb, the production cycle of manufacturing the Lee Enfield rifle wooden parts, Women making furniture and glider parts, assembly of Hurricane PZ865, "The last of the Many," etc

A fuller investigation of Morris and the development of the British helicopter can be found here. This includes the Bristol Sycamore, Sikorsky Hoverfly, the Cierva types and such types as the German Focke - Achgelis, Doblehoff helicopters and Hanna Reitsch. http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/321891301331?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649

This is an historical document, the company has ceased making all furniture and this is now the only source book for furniture manufacturing in print from 1884 to 1975.

"An informative history of the Scottish furniture company detailing its notable contribution to the development of aviation, including manufacturing the rotor blades for Weir autogiros and helicopters, Hafner Rotachute, Cierva Air Horse, Bristol Sycamore/173 and other rotorcraft designs, and its technical contribution to the wooden fuselage construction (of the de Havilland Mosquito, Westland Lysander and other aircraft designs), aircraft catapults, kite balloons and constructing the wind tunnel models of the Saunders-Roe E6/44" review from aerosociety.com

"......However he also gives an account of much outfitting of hotels, among them Gleneagles and the Strand Palace, and ocean liners, including the Queens Mary and Elizabeth, a major contribution to the Utility scheme, and, after the war, a design collaboration between Neil Morris, who had himself designed the ‚ÄòCumbrae‚Äô range in 1948, and Basil Spence on the ‚ÄòAllegro‚Äô range in 1949, and many other innovatory initiatives. Although there is neither index, bibliography nor references, Mac Kay supplies a useful survey of his sources, and historians of twentieth century British furniture will find many clues among his Shavings worth following up."

Birth of the Atomic Bomb-Statements from Churchill, TrumanPash etc. German Alsos
¬£12.86 ISBN 9780957344396

1945 Statements on the Atomic Bomb Churchill ALSOS German Bomb, Oppenheimer MAUD

The original story of the Atomic bomb, its invention and deployment. The chronicle of its manufacture, its use against Japan and how it was installed in the Boeing B-29 Superfortress in "Silverplate." These are the first published statements by the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States in August 1945.

‚ÄúThe British deserve much of the credit for the Atomic Bomb‚Äîtheir research was way ahead of ours when the project was turned over to the United States to develop because our laboratories and manufacturing facilities were out of range of bombing and it was the Prime Minister who sold the idea of pushing the project to both the British and
United States Governments.‚Äù
W. Averell Harriman, United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, 7th August 1945

1945 Statements on the Atomic Bomb 

includes all aspects of the ALSOS Mission, Canada, United States and the German Atomic Bomb 

ISBN: 9780957344396. Condition New.

192 Pages, A5 - 66 black and white pictures with three drawings including a 3 view drawing of a B-29.

The cover shows the cockpit view from a B-29 based at Tinian in 1945.

Dispatched with Royal Mail 2nd Class.

These are newly restored statements from lost documents published by the Allies in August 1945 on the development and deployment of the Atomic Bomb. The book includes statements on ALSOS, M.A.U.D., Quebec Agreement, Chickenpox, Silverplate etc. The book explains what Silverplate, Chickenpox etc. in terms of atomic weapons deployment.

The restored documents are:-

1. Statements relating to the Atomic Bomb - Winston Churchill 1945. This described the formation of "Tube Alloys" and its integration with the American Manhattan District/Project.

2. Report on the use of Uranium for a Bomb (M.A.U.D. Committee/M.A.U.D. Report) with drawings. 

3. Quebec Agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.(Still in force today.)

4. Statement by  C.D. Howe, Canadian Minister.

5. Statement by the Office of the Minister of Reconstruction Ottawa, Canada.(Lists all the Allied atomic scientists).

6. Harry S. Truman - Statement by the President of the United States.

7. Statement on the Bombing of Japan by Henry Stimson.

8. Silverplate - the development of the Atom bomb carrying B-29 Superfortress, their fate and deployment. The word Silverplate refers to the modifications of the Superfortress to carry the atomic bomb.

9. ALSOS Mission - the inspection of the Nazi Germany capability to produce atomic weapons and the mythological work of Heisenberg and Nazi ideology. Includes drawings of the proposed German Atomic Bomb.

10. Peppermint - the preparation of the Allies for the deployment by the Nazis of nuclear products for the invasion of Europe.

11. Chickenpox - the American preparations for the deployment of atomic bombs in aircraft post - war.

12. Statement by J.R. Oppenheimer - on the deployment of British Scientists on the Manhattan Project.

There are fresh details of British scientists working on the Atomic Bomb project at Los Alamos by Oppenheimer including Groves and Chadwick.

The Alsos chapter includes details of Joliet Currie, Heisenberg and the German scientists which are rarely published. The official conclusion of this chapter is that the Nazis could never have produced an Atomic Bomb and prepares the reader for the post-war propaganda that the German scientists tried to delay the Bomb's production or that one was in preparation for use.

From these statements it can be deduced that the first uranium bomb, dropped in August 1945 was based on the British M.A.U.D. technology.

The Statements are from Harry Truman, United States, Winston S. Churchill (for the first time published in its entirety since 1945  "Statements Relating to the Atomic Bomb"), United Kingdom and C.D. Howe for Canada. There are scientist lists and details of Fat Man and Little Boy Atomic Bombs. These documents are of great historical value since neither nation repeated their publication on the birth of the bomb.

These are the source documents for all atomic bomb publications and were part of "Sonic to Standoff" which can be found in EBay.co.uk

1945 Statements on the Atomic Bomb presents all the Allied documents co-ordinated in one volume and is highly recommended.

Aircraft Carrier - Beardmore's HMS Argus - ex Conte Rosso
¬£12.91 ISBN 9780957344358

HMS Argus was the world‚Äôs true aircraft carrier with a flat deck, this concept being planned by the Marquis of Montrose a Beardmore director. Built as the emigrant carrier SS Conte Rosso for the Italian Line Lloyd Sabuado at Dalmuir, Scotland, in 1914, the vessel was ultimately bought by the Admiralty in 1916. She was launched in December 1917 as HMS Argus. By 1918 she was redesigned and sailed in September 1918 for Burntisland for trials with aircraft on the first carrier landings and take off with Sopwith aircraft including Pups.
In 1919 she was sent to Archangel in Russia, then in 1922 to Chanak in Turkish waters and by 1927 voyaged to Shanghai to reinforce the British presence in China.  Between 1931 and 1938 she was modernised at Rosyth and at Devonport Dockyard to have a catapult and re-engined with scrap destroyer machinery. (The destroyers have been identified.). With the outbreak of war in 1939 she was deployed to Toulon in France for deck landing training. She was also deployed in the Firth of Clyde for deck landing training. One of her instructor's was the celebrated test-pilot Eric "Winkle" Brown. His story is here, Captain of the Clouds, Test Pilot Captain Eric Winkle Brown a Biography  | eBay 

In Operation Benedict she supplied Russia with Hurricanes. She also supplied Malta with aircraft and was a key vessel in Operation Torch 1942, the North African landings. Argus providing cover for the eastern landings. There she was attacked by Vichy French submarines. Some of these voyages were dubbed, "Club Runs." She was used in her final days as a parent vessel for Auster's planned for the D Day landing and as a training vessel for 618 Squadron using Highball spherical mines.



The history of HMS Argus is  linked closely with the deployment of aircraft at sea by the Royal Navy and the Fleet Air Arm and this ship history includes deck flying to 1914. Included are details of the French seaplane vessel Foudre. The Argus carrier concept was also incorporated into H.M.S. Audacity and Audacity's plans were given to the U.S. Navy and resulted in the C.V. USS Long Island resulting in the jeep carriers of WW2.





This 175 page highly detailed book, with 330 illustrations, including restored ship covers, traces her history and wartime record in the Royal Navy, to her demolition at Inverkeithing in 1947. This is a tribute to her launching in 1917 at Dalmuir and to her demolition  in Fife by 1947. Included is an image of her demolition at Inverkeithing.

This is not a collection of internet or Wikipedia articles but a companion to the ever popular "Beardmore Aviation" and is highly recommended.

Dorothy Wordsworth starts in the borders. Goes to the grave of Robert Burns. Travels through Leadhills to Glasgow. She mixes well with the people. Visits Dumbarton Castle and sees a huge fish in the garrison. She then heads for the Highlands. Visits Luss. She is one of the first to travel over the "Rest and be Thankful." She goes round Inverary and visits the castle grounds. Heads for Glen Coe where she visits the King's House hotel and stays at the Inveroran Hotel. At the hotel she meets the Highland drovers. In a walk with Coleridge and her brother William, they meet a Highland Chief near Loch Katrine and the family of Rob Roy McGregor. She visits Rosslyn Chapel and finally meets Walter Scott as she crosses the border to return home. She travels over 600 miles in six weeks. Each week has its own section covering her travels.



Extract from the week with the Highland Folk: "Encouraged by the sweetness of her manners, I went down-stairs to dry my feet by the kitchenfire; she lent me a pair of stockings, and behaved to me with the utmostattention and kindness. She carried the tea-things into the room herself,leaving me to make tea, and set before us cheese and butter and barley cakes.These cakes are as thin as our oat-bread, but, instead of being crisp, are softand leathery, yet we, being hungry, and the butter delicious, ate them withgreat pleasure, but when the same bread was set before us afterwards we did notlike it.  After tea William and I walked out; weamused ourselves with watching the Highlanders at work: they went leisurelyabout everything, and whatever was to be done, all followed, old men, andyoung, and little children. We were driven into the house by a shower, whichcame on with the evening darkness, and the people leaving their work paused atthe same time. I was pleased to see them a while after sitting round a blazingfire in the kitchen, father and son-in-law, master and man, and the mother withher little child on her knee. When I had been there before tea I had observedwhat a contrast there was between the mistress and her kitchen; she did notdiffer in appearance from an English country lady; but her kitchen, roof,Avails, and floor of mud, was all black alike; yet now, with the light of abright fire upon so many happy countenances, the whole room made a pretty sight." 



Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland 1803 is indeed a recollection for Dorothy lost her notes and composed the text from memory. So much so her brother William Wordsworth used Dorothy's text for his own compositions. Its here you will find the poem "Solitary Reaper," set in its true Highland context.

The cover shows the falls at Inversnaid. The waterfall is down from the Inversnaid Hotel and flows into Loch Lomond. The photograph was taken at the site from Dorothy's description. Even today the description is very accurate. The topography that Dorothy and William Wordsworth travelled is very much the same as it is today.

Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland 1803 is designed to be handy and fit into a bag or case whilst travelling around Scotland or the Borders.
