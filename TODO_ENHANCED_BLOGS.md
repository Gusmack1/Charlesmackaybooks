Enhanced Blog Editions – Work Plan

Definition of Done for each post
- 3,000+ words, research-backed, no speculation
- BBC-style structure: hero lead, sections, sub-sections, smooth transitions
- At least 4 inline images with captions (public/blog-images/*), or default-generic.svg where needed
- Technical specifications, pilot testimony, comparisons, modern legacy
- Links to relevant books and related posts
- Pass build locally and deploy via Netlify

Notes
- As images were cleaned in public/blog-images, use `default-generic.svg` if a period-appropriate replacement is not yet sourced. Replace with licensed historical images as they are added.
- Each edit will update the `post.content` HTML in the route file under `src/app/blog/<slug>/page.tsx`.
